    A northern pike, or *esox lucius*. [#img1]_

**pikepdf** is a Python library allowing creation, manipulation and repair of
PDF files. It provides a wrapper around the C++ PDF content transformation
library, `QPDF <https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf>`_.

Python + QPDF = "py" + "qpdf" = "pyqpdf", which looks like a dyslexia test. Say it
out loud, and it sounds like "pikepdf".
