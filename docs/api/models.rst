Support models
**************

Support models are abstracts over "raw" objects within a Pdf. For example, a page
in a PDF is a Dictionary with set to ``/Type`` of ``/Page``. The Dictionary in
that case is the "raw" object. Upon establishing what type of object it is, we
can wrap it with a support model that adds features to ensure consistency with
the PDF specification.

pikepdf does not currently apply support models to "raw" objects automatically,
but might do so in a future release (this would break backward compatibility).

.. autoclass:: pikepdf.Page
    :members:

    Support model wrapper around a raw page dictionary object.

    To initialize a ``Page`` support model:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pikepdf import Pdf, Page

        Pdf = open(...)
        page_support_model = Page(pdf.pages[0])

.. autoclass:: pikepdf.PdfMatrix
    :members:

    .. attribute:: a

    .. attribute:: b

    .. attribute:: c

    .. attribute:: d

    .. attribute:: e

    .. attribute:: f

        Return one of the six "active values" of the affine matrix. ``e`` and ``f``
        correspond to x- and y-axis translation respectively. The other four
        letters are a 2Ã—2 matrix that can express rotation, scaling and skewing;
        ``a=1 b=0 c=0 d=1`` is the identity matrix.

.. class:: pikepdf.models.EncryptionMethod

    Describes which encryption method was used on a particular part of a
    PDF. These values are returned by :class:`pikepdf.EncryptionInfo` but
    are not currently used to specify how encryption is requested.

    .. attribute:: none

        Data was not encrypted.

    .. attribute:: unknown

        An unknown algorithm was used.

    .. attribute:: rc4

        The RC4 encryption algorithm was used (obsolete).

    .. attribute:: aes

        The AES-based algorithm was used as described in the PDF 1.7 reference manual.

    .. attribute:: aesv3

        An improved version of the AES-based algorithm was used as described in the
        Adobe Supplement to the ISO 32000, requiring PDF 1.7 extension level 3. This
        algorithm still uses AES, but allows both AES-128 and AES-256, and improves how
        the key is derived from the password.

.. autoclass:: pikepdf.models.EncryptionInfo

.. autoclass:: pikepdf.Annotation
    :members:

    Describes an annotation in a PDF, such as a comment, underline, copy editing marks,
    interactive widgets, redactions, 3D objects, sound and video clips.

    See the PDF reference manual section 12.5.6 for the full list of annotation types
    and definition of terminology.

    .. versionadded:: 2.12

.. autoclass:: pikepdf._qpdf.Attachments
    :members:

    This interface provides access to any files that are attached to this PDF,
    exposed as a Python :class:`collections.abc.MutableMapping` interface.

    .. versionadded:: 3.0

.. autoclass:: pikepdf._qpdf.FileSpec
    :members:

    A file specification that accounts for the possibility of multiple data streams.

    In the vast majority of cases, only a single AttachedFileStream is present and
    this object can be mostly ignored. Call :meth:`get_stream` and be on your way:

    .. code-block:: python

        pdf = Pdf.open(...)

        fs: FileSpec = pdf.attachments['example.txt']
        stream: AttachedFileStream = fs.get_stream()

    To attach a new file to a PDF, you must construct a ``FileSpec``.

    .. code-block:: python

        pdf = Pdf.open(...)

        with open('somewhere/spreadsheet.xlsx', 'rb') as data_to_attach:
            fs = FileSpec(pdf, data_to_attach)
            pdf.attachments['spreadsheet.xlsx'] = fs

    PDF supports the concept of having multiple, platform-specialized versions of the
    file attachment (similar to resource forks on some operating systems). In theory,
    this attachment ought to be the same file, but
    encoded in different ways. For example, perhaps a PDF includes a text file encoded
    with Windows line endings (``\r\n``) and a different one with POSIX line endings
    (``\n``). Similarly, PDF allows for the possibility that you need to encode
    platform-specific filenames.

    If you have to deal with multiple versions, use :meth:`get_all_filenames` to
    enumerate those available.

    Described in the |pdfrm| section 7.11.3.
